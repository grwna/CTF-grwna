Black Box Activation

Analysis: Following the trail has led to this: a perfect image of a serene scene, the last memory saved by a machine. There is a secret sealed inside it, and the machine's fragmented memory suggests lulling it with a forgotten song is the key.

If you reached this point, inform The Empress of your progress.

The 'song' will be sent out to a selected (random) few of you via email.
It is made up of 8 words.
Connect each word with a '-', then unlock the secret inside the image.
