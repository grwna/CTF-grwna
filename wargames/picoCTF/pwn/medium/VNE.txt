Payload: 'SECRET_DIR="/root/; cat /root/flag.txt" ./bin'

Explanation:
The binary uses the SECRET_DIR environment variable to run the ls command.
Where the command is likely: "ls $SECRET_DIR" or something like that.

Because its running as just a normal command, adding a semicolon ';' will be parsed as ending a command.
Which makes the 'cat' a separate command run by the binary.
