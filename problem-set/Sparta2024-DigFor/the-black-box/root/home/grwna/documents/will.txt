I feel so blessed to have been able to join this organization.

For I - unlike other machine lifeforms - have found meaning in death.  At first, all I did was study the religion of humans.  But then I came to know the existence called "God."

To be honest, I still do not know what "God" truly is. But there is something else I learned since coming here - a life that seems devoid of purpose when faced alone can be perceived as meaningful when you're with someone else.  In a world consumed by conflict and hatred, gaining such peace of mind was a happy thing indeed.

For us, death is not the end.  It is the beginning.
There is nothing so happy as becoming "God" with everyone else.
