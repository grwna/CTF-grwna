ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH KARAMAZOV WAS THE THIRD SON OF FYODOR PAVLOVITCH KARAMAZOV, 
A LAND OWNER WELL KNOWN IN OUR DISTRICT IN HIS OWN DAY, AND STILL REMEMBERED AMONG 
US OWING TO HIS GLOOMY AND TRAGIC DEATH, WHICH HAPPENED THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, AND 
WHICH I SHALL DESCRIBE IN ITS PROPER PLACE. FOR THE PRESENT I WILL ONLY SAY THAT 
THIS LANDOWNERFOR SO WE USED TO CALL HIM, ALTHOUGH HE HARDLY SPENT A DAY OF HIS LIFE 
ON HIS OWN ESTATEWAS A STRANGE TYPE, YET ONE PRETTY FREQUENTLY TO BE MET WITH, A TYPE 
ABJECT AND VICIOUS AND AT THE SAME TIME SENSELESS. BUT HE WAS ONE OF THOSE SENSELESS 
PERSONS WHO ARE VERY WELL CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER THEIR WORLDLY AFFAIRS, AND, 
APPARENTLY, AFTER NOTHING ELSE. FYODOR PAVLOVITCH, FOR INSTANCE, BEGAN WITH NEXT TO 
NOTHING; HIS ESTATE WAS OF THE SMALLEST; HE RAN TO DINE AT OTHER MEN'S TABLES, AND 
FASTENED ON THEM AS A TOADY, YET AT HIS DEATH IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD A HUNDRED 
THOUSAND ROUBLES IN HARD CASH. AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS ALL HIS LIFE ONE OF THE MOST 
SENSELESS, FANTASTICAL FELLOWS IN THE WHOLE DISTRICT. I REPEAT, IT WAS NOT 
STUPIDITYTHE MAJORITY OF THESE FANTASTICAL FELLOWS ARE SHREWD AND INTELLIGENT 
ENOUGHBUT JUST SENSELESSNESS, AND A PECULIAR NATIONAL FORM OF IT.
